# Using ssh_setup.sh
### This readme refers to the file ssh_setup.sh

### _Just a note that to paste into terminal, use &nbsp;```CTRL + SHIFT + V``` instead of &nbsp;```CTRL + V```_

The first step is to install ansible, which is used to generate the template. Do this by typing: 
```bash
sudo apt-get install ansible
```

Run the file using 
```bash
bash ssh_setup.sh
```
in its directory.

It should guide you through with prompts.

### __The first prompt is:__
```
Please enter the path where the rsa file should be generated (absolute):
```
For our sensors, enter 
```
/home/pi/.ssh/stem_server_rsa
```

### __The next prompt is:__
```
Please enter the path where the playbook is located:
```
The playbook being refered here to is from the github repository. It should be:
```
/home/pi/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/generateSSH.yaml
```

### __The next prompt is similar.__
```
Please enter the path where the yaml vars file is located:
```
Enter:
```
/home/pi/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/server_host.yaml
```

### __The next prompt is:__
```
Please enter the target ssh host:
```
This is asking for the IP address of the target computer. In our case, this is ```10.32.230.37```

### __The next prompt is similar:__
```
Please enter the target ssh user:
```
This is asking for the username of the target computer. In our case, this is ```stem-server```

### __Potential prompt:__
If the rsa_file you entered already exists, it'll give you this prompt asking you if you want to overwrite it or not. 
```
/home/mattecatte/.ssh/test_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? 
```
It should be fine if you type in ```y```.

### __The next two prompts are:__
```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
```
and
```
Enter same passphrase again: 
```
Just leave these blank by hitting enter.

### __Next prompt:__

After spitting out a bunch of garbage, including a cool randomart image, it'll ask you to edit the yaml vars file. Instead, don't do that and ignore it and the proceding 
```
Are you sure?!
```

### __Next prompt:__

It will prompt you for the password to stem-server@10.32.230.37.
The password is 'password' (_very secure_).

If this is successful, you are almost done.

It'll then spit out more stuff. Here's where the errors could happen. If the files you entered in earlier weren't good, it'll produce a big wall of red text. Other wise, you should see some green and yellow text and then 
```bash
'SSH set up on this machine with the target host and user: $user@$host'
```

### __Next step:__

The next step is to copy the generated config file to the ```.ssh``` directory. Do this by typing in:
```bash
cp ~/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/config ~/.ssh
```

## Sample runthrough

### _This is me running this file on my computer. Just a note that I didn't have access to the server at the time of writing, so the last command (cp) isn't run._

```
[mattecatte@localhost STEM-SLAM]$ bash ssh_setup.sh 
Please enter the path where the rsa file should be generated (absolute): /home/mattecatte/.ssh/test_rsa
Please enter the path where the playbook is located: /home/mattecatte/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/generateSSH.yaml
Please enter the path where the yaml vars file is located: /home/mattecatte/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/hosts.yaml
Please enter the target ssh host: 10.32.230.37
Please enter the target ssh user: stem-server

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again:

The key fingerprint is:

Before preceding, edit the yaml vars file to ADD your information. I would reccomend copy pasting an earlier host and then editing the data.
Once you are done this, hit enter to continue.
Are you sure?!

```

You will now have to do this on the stem-server.

Before doing this, you need to edit ```STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/generateSSH.yaml``` and change /home/mattecatte to /home/pi where ever it appears.

There, run the same ```bash ssh_setup.sh``` command, this time replacing all the ```/home/pi/``` with ```/home/stem-server/```s and ```stem_server_rsa``` with ```<your data type>_pi_rsa``` where <your data type> is your data type.
  
When you get to the hostname and IP bit, enter ```pi``` for the hostname, and the IP of the Pi for the IP (this can be found by running ```hostname -I``` on the Pi).

When the ```Before preceding (should be proceding), edit the yaml vars file [...]``` shows up, open a new terminal window and ```cd``` into ```~/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/```. Edit the vars file by typing in ```nano server_host.yaml```. The file should look like this:
```yaml
---
_hosts:
   stem_server: {
   IP: 10.32.230.37,  #Your IP address here 
   nickname: stem_server,
   IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/stem_server_rsa, 
   User: stem-server
   }
```

Copy this:
```yaml
   stem_server: {
   IP: 10.32.230.37,  #Your IP address here 
   nickname: stem_server,
   IdentityFile: ~/.ssh/stem_server_rsa, 
   User: stem-server
   }
```
and paste it below what already exists.

Then, change the following (in the one you copy pasted):
You can look at what already exists to guide you.

```stem_server: {``` : Change stem-server to <your data type>_pi (the same one you used above without the trailing ```_rsa```).
  
```IP:``` : Change 10.32.230.37 to the IP of the Pi, which you found earlier.

```nickname:``` : Change this to the same thing you put for the first line (instead of stem_server).

```IdentityFile: ``` : Change the ```stem_server_rsa``` to ```<your data type>_pi_rsa```.

```User: ``` : Change ```stem-server``` to ```pi```.
  
Hit ```CTRL + X``` to exit, make sure to save the document when exiting (it will prompt you).

Go back to the other terminal window again, and enter through the two prompts.

It will prompt you for the Pi's password, it should be ```raspberry```.

Then copy the generated config file by running:
```bash
cp ~/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/config ~/.ssh
```
The final step is to ```nano``` into ~/STEM-SLAM/server_files/controls/ansible/SLAM-hosts and add your ip address and the ```ansible_user``` line. Follow the already existing examples if you're stuck.`
